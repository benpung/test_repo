# This helper utility facilitates the git flow process
# laid out @ https://dot-confluence.lilly.com/display/IC/Git+Flow+Process
# The usage of this utility is as follows
# 1. To initiate work on a card: gg start card-id, e.g. gg start LUSD-1234
# 2. To deploy code to dev: gg dev card-id, e.g. gg dev LUSD-1234
# 3. To deploy code to qa: gg qa card-id, e.g. gg qa LUSD-1234
# Note: This utility is a very basic helper utility. It allows quick review of PRs by
#   tagging commits with appropriate messages at checkpoints
#   It is not meant as a replacement for git command line utilities
